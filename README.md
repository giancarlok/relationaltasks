# relationaltasks

In the cognitive_tests folder, you can find a series of relational psychophysics tasks taken from https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14601 (testing for OoD on unseen objects) as well as additional harder variations (not only testing for OoD on unseen objects but also on unseen relations) we have created.

In relational_games, you can find (the sequential versions) of a subset of tasks taken from https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10307
